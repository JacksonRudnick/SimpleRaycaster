# Simple Raycaster

This is a very basic raycaster I threw together in a couple of hours with research.

There is a lot of things I want to improve but I need to balance school work and my fun projects for now.

Slow is the attempt using rectangles to render the walls on the cpu

Main is the new attempt using SDL's renderer
